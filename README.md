# GooseMenager
Adds a file where you can disable goose actions!

After first time of starting goose with this mod, "GooseTasks.txt" file will be added to folder, there you can disable action by changing True to False on the right side of action name!
(To apply changes you need to restart goose)

(If all actions are disabled, all actions will be enabled)

(Disabling will work with all goose tasks, including tasks from mods!)
